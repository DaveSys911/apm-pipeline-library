Install Node.js with NVM and run some command in a pre-configured environment multiplatform. For such
it's recommended to use the `cmd` step.

```
  withNodeEnv(version: '14.17.5'){
    cmd(label: 'Node version', script: 'node --version')
  }
```

* version: Node.js version to install, if it is not set, it'll use [default version](#nodeDefaultVersion)
